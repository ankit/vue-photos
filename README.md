# vue-photos

Vue Photos is a minimal and opinionated display for self-hosted photos built using Vue.js. The design and user experience don't really allow much flexibility at the moment. On the flip side, it is quick and easy to set up.

- Responsive CSS grid based layout for variably sized images
- Minimalistic display and navigation support
- Built-in routing and permalinks using vue-router

Still a fairly early release, without tests and likely not very robust. Acessibility has not been robustly tested
